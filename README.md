My project name: The Importance of Changes in Age, Gender and Fasting Blood Sugar Levels in Predicting Heart Disease with Artificial Neural Network

My project abstract: Heart disease continues to pose a significant global health challenge, necessitating innovative approaches for early detection and intervention. This paper explores the integration of artificial neural networks (ANN) in healthcare to address the challenges associated with heart disease. Leveraging the expanding digital real-time data in the healthcare industry, the study emphasizes the potential of intelligent systems to handle diverse medical information. Recognizing cardiovascular diseases as a leading cause of mortality, emphasis is placed on the World Health Organization's projections and the advocacy for early identification using ANN algorithms. The research centers on artificial neural networks, particularly their application in predictive modeling for heart disease. By investigating critical parameters such as age, gender and fasting blood sugar levels governing model performance, the aim is to enhance the accuracy of these models. Utilizing the UCI Heart Disease Research Dataset, an 
exploration is conducted into demographic, clinical, physiological, and diagnostic features to train models for heart disease prediction. This research adds to the expanding body of literature on ANN applications in healthcare, focusing on artificial neural networks for predictive modeling in heart disease analysis.
